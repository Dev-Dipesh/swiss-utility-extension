# Swiss Utility

Small targeted utilities for the web. Panel is hidden by default and appears only when you click the extension icon on a page.

## Utilities
- Right-click & Select: enable right-click menu and text selection/copy.
- Reading Mode: simplify layout and improve readability.
- Read Aloud: read selected or detected page text using browser text-to-speech.

## Features
- Permanent in-page panel with minimize option (shown on demand).
- Utility list with per-utility toggles.
- Per-site toggle memory.
- Utilities do not require refresh.

## Usage
1. Load unpacked in Chrome:
   - `chrome://extensions` → enable Developer mode → Load unpacked
2. Click the extension icon on a page to show/hide the panel.
3. Toggle utilities on/off as needed (no refresh required).

## Defaults
Set global defaults for new sites in the options page. Per-site toggles override defaults.

## Notes
- Some sites may still block certain interactions via scripts that are hard to override.
- If a site breaks, disable the utility for a quick fallback.
